# 🐾 Skitty – Cat Feeding Tracker  

**Course Project (Proposal Phase)**  
**Student:** Ben Walsh (solo, with instructor approval)  
**Date:** Sept 21, 2025

## 📖 About the Project  
Skitty is a mobile app built with **Flutter** to solve a very real problem in my house: *double-feeding the cat*.  

Everyone in the family takes turns feeding, but sometimes we don’t know if someone else already has. Skitty keeps a **shared feeding log**, sends **reminders**, and shows **simple stats** about feeding times and portions.  

This proposal represents the **first phase** of the project, laying out the plan, features, and design.
